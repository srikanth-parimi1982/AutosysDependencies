Imagine you are an ETL pipeline, Autosys job designer and also who is good at progamming languages and frameworks for both frontend and backend. Need your help with creating me a streamlit based application that can do below functionality

You will receive 2 input files. Firstly, one consolidated Autosys jil scripts code that has all jobs and their depenencies info.
Secondly, current run information of all the Autosys jobs execution which contains the jobs run information, generated using autorep -J, in all possible statuses.

I need you to process these 2 input files and create me a streamlit based application that can produce me a knowledge graph kind of dashboard view which helps users to understand 2 things.

1. providing the dependency view amongst the autosys jobs
2. based on the job execution status should highlight or color code the list of jobs that could get impacted in that graph or node structure view.
3. If a job is in running state then highlight the dependent jobs info / nodes in amber
4. If a job is in failed or terminated state then highlight the dependent jobs info / nodes in red
5. If a job has completed successfully then highlight the completed ones in green
